# scraping-political-graveyard
This code scrapes the website 'The Political Graveyard' to create a historical database of US politicians.

The data on the website does not have tags. So, I have tried to use the pattern in which they have been rendered to impose a structure. This inevitably leads to some errors which need to be suitably cleaned before any analysis. 

Please read the README.pdf file for details on code.
